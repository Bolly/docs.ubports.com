"This first section will introduce you to the specifics of porting Ubuntu "
"Touch to an Android device. Note that it is written with the general public "
"in mind, not primarily the experienced porting developer. In subsequent "
"sections we have made an effort to differentiate by keeping the main text "
"more concise in order to meet the needs of the more experienced reader, "
"while providing links to supplementary reading for the less experienced."

"The guide as a whole is written as a sequence of steps describing how an "
"ideal port might proceed. However, porting is unpredictable and messy. Every "
"device is different and in reality you will likely iterate and revisit some "
"steps, skip over other steps and uncover new and undocumented challenges."

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:13
msgid ""
"Ubuntu Touch is an open source operating system for mobile devices. It can "
"be ported to devices that originally shipped with Android OS. Alas, the "
"majority of these devices are dependent to some degree on proprietary "
"software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:15
msgid ""
"To be specific, device vendors tend to keep the code that speaks directly to "
"the device hardware (the low level device drivers) proprietary. These "
"components are commonly called the 'vendor blobs'. The vendor blobs need to "
"be incorporated into an Ubuntu Touch port. Note that these components are "
"specific not only to each device, but also to each Android version. It is "
"therefore necessary to secure the correct version of these components when "
"building a port."
msgstr ""

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:17
msgid ""
"This is why Ubuntu Touch cannot be built completely from source code for "
"most commercial devices. Instead, porting the system to these devices "
"involves integrating the previously mentioned vendor blobs into the rest of "
"the system, which can be built from source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:19
msgid ""
"The next component of Ubuntu Touch is a pre-compiled root filesystem which "
"needs to be installed on the device. This component does not communicate "
"directly with the device hardware. Instead, this communication is mediated "
"by a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) which needs to be built for each "
"specific device, because each device has its specific hardware architecture. "
"This component is called Halium and is available in different versions (5.1 "
"which is largely obsolete, 7.1, and 9 as of writing) corresponding to "
"different Android versions."

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:21
msgid ""
"The Halium project enables Linux systems to run on Android hardware. It is a "
"joint effort by multiple mobile operating systems, notably Plasma mobile, "
"Lune OS and UBports. UBports porting builds on top of Halium porting. "
"Consequently, you will be using both the Halium porting guide and the "
"UBports porting guide. At times it can also be helpful to test with one of "
"the other operating systems to debug a problem from different angles."

"Halium is thus an indispensible part of an Ubuntu Touch port and is "
"available in the form of open source software. Developing a new version of "
"Halium is a very considerable task which is the why only a few versions of "
